# Nava Platform

Welcome to the Nava Platform! This is the home repository for Nava's Platform tools that empowers teams to accelerate their delivery through self-service tools and training.

To learn more about the platform, check out our [Platform space on Nava Sage](https://navasage.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLAT/overview).

## Application Templates

Application templates allow project teams to quickly spin up new production ready applications. Engineers can copy the templates to their own project's GitHub repository in order to get started more quickly. The templates provide a lot of default technical decisions that represent Nava's best practices.

We currently have the following templates:

- [template-infra](https://github.com/navapbc/template-infra) - Template for setting up application infrastructure, including infrastructure for operating terraform itself.
- [template-application-nextjs](https://github.com/navapbc/template-application-nextjs) - Template for user-facing web applications built with NextJS.
- [template-application-flask](https://github.com/navapbc/template-application-flask) - Template for APIs and offline processes built with Python Flask.
